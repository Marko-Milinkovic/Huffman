this is an example of a huffman tree. huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. 
it was developed by david a. huffman while he was a phd student at mit, and it is widely used in various forms today. 
the algorithm assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters. 
this ensures that the overall size of the encoded data is smaller than the original, especially when there are many repeated characters. 

for instance, in this sample text, the character 'e' appears many times, so it might be given a shorter code than less frequent characters 
like 'z' or 'q'. this way, when we encode the entire input, we save space. the more predictable the input is, the more efficient 
the compression becomes. 

huffman coding is the foundation of several real-world formats like deflate (used in zip files), gzip, and png images. 
in practice, the encoding and decoding processes involve building a binary tree based on character frequencies, 
then traversing the tree to assign binary codes.

this example text is meant to simulate a realistic input, with varying character frequencies, to test your huffman 
compressor and decompressor implementation. if your algorithm works correctly, it should reduce the size of this file 
and be able to reconstruct it perfectly during decompression.
